## [2026-03-27] — Move architecture docs to docs/architecture/ subfolder

### Summary

Relocated all architecture documentation references from `docs/` to `docs/architecture/`. The `docs/` root already contained a landing page (`index.html`, `og-image.png`), so architecture docs now live in their own subfolder to avoid mixing concerns. Created the `docs/architecture/` directory and updated every reference in `AGENTS.md`.

### Added
- `docs/architecture/` — New directory for all architecture documentation files

### Changed
- `AGENTS.md` — Updated all 20+ references from `docs/*.md` to `docs/architecture/*.md` (Rule section, section headers, Workflow mappings, Edge Cases)

### Architecture Impact
- Documentation path convention changed: `docs/architecture/` is now the canonical location for ARCHITECTURE.md, DOMAIN.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md, APPLICATION.md, IPC.md, RENDERER.md

### Migration Notes
- Any existing `docs/*.md` architecture files (if created manually) should be moved to `docs/architecture/`

## [2026-03-27] — Motif Ledger: full-stack feature from domain to UI

### Summary

Added the Motif Ledger — a structured JSON-backed system for tracking motif systems, character entries, structural devices, foreshadow threads, minor characters, flagged phrases, and audit logs per book. The domain types and application service were already built in a prior session; this session completed the IPC wiring, preload bridge, Zustand store, view routing, sidebar navigation, and all 7 CRUD tab panels.

### Added
- `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts` — Added `motifLedger:load`, `motifLedger:save`, `motifLedger:getUnauditedChapters` IPC handlers
- `src/preload/index.ts` — Added `motifLedger` namespace to the contextBridge API
- `src/renderer/stores/motifLedgerStore.ts` — Zustand store with full CRUD for all 7 ledger sections, dirty tracking, save/load
- `src/renderer/components/MotifLedger/MotifLedgerView.tsx` — Main view with 7-tab navigation, save button, Cmd+S shortcut
- `src/renderer/components/MotifLedger/SystemsTab.tsx` — Motif systems CRUD
- `src/renderer/components/MotifLedger/EntriesTab.tsx` — Character motif entries CRUD with filtering
- `src/renderer/components/MotifLedger/StructuralTab.tsx` — Structural devices CRUD
- `src/renderer/components/MotifLedger/ForeshadowTab.tsx` — Foreshadow registry with status grouping
- `src/renderer/components/MotifLedger/MinorCharactersTab.tsx` — Minor character catch-all CRUD
- `src/renderer/components/MotifLedger/FlaggedPhrasesTab.tsx` — Flagged phrases CRUD with category-specific fields

### Changed
- `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts` — Added `IMotifLedgerService` to services type, `MotifLedger` to type imports
- `src/preload/index.ts` — Added `MotifLedger` type import
- `src/renderer/stores/viewStore.ts` — Added `'motif-ledger'` to `ViewId`
- `src/renderer/components/Layout/AppLayout.tsx` — Added `MotifLedgerView` to `ViewContent`
- `src/renderer/components/Layout/Sidebar.tsx` — Added motif-ledger nav item

### Architecture Impact
- New IPC channels: `motifLedger:load`, `motifLedger:save`, `motifLedger:getUnauditedChapters`
