## [2026-03-27] — Architecture refactor prompt suite

### Summary

Created a complete set of 14 encapsulated refactoring prompts to address the architectural issues documented in `issues.md`. Includes a state tracker for cross-context handoffs, a dependency graph, and a master loop prompt that drives execution through all prompts in order. No production code changes — this is the planning and orchestration layer for the refactor.

### Added
- `prompts/arch/STATE.md` — State tracker with prompt status, dependency graph, and handoff notes
- `prompts/arch/MASTER.md` — Master loop prompt that reads state, picks next prompt, executes, and loops
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-01.md` — Extract prompt templates from constants.ts to agent .md files
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-02.md` — Extract status messages from constants.ts to statusMessages.ts
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-03.md` — Add IChatService and IUsageService interfaces
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-04.md` — Extract StreamManager from ChatService
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-05.md` — Extract AuditService from ChatService
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-06.md` — Extract PitchRoomService from ChatService
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-07.md` — Extract HotTakeService from ChatService
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-08.md` — Extract AdhocRevisionService from ChatService
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-09.md` — Slim ChatService to router (capstone)
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-10.md` — Document renderer value imports exception
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-11.md` — Clean up Wrangler vestige
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-12.md` — Audit and fix silent error swallowing
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-13.md` — Add database migration system
- `prompts/arch/ARCH-14.md` — Standardize agent filenames

### Architecture Impact
- None — no production code changed. This is a planning artifact.

### Migration Notes
- None

## [2026-03-27] — Remove phrase ledger, consolidate into motif ledger

### Summary

Eliminated the standalone phrase ledger (`source/phrase-ledger.md`) as a separate artifact. All phrase/repetition tracking now lives exclusively in the `flaggedPhrases` section of `source/motif-ledger.json`. The motif ledger already had this section — the phrase ledger was a legacy Markdown format that duplicated its function. Lumen's Lens 8 audit now writes directly to the motif ledger's `flaggedPhrases` array instead of producing a separate file. The audit violation type `phrase-ledger-hit` was renamed to `flagged-phrase` across all types, agent prompts, and UI code.

### Changed
- `src/domain/types.ts` — Renamed `AuditViolationType` variant `'phrase-ledger-hit'` → `'flagged-phrase'`
- `src/domain/constants.ts` — Removed `source/phrase-ledger.md` from `AGENT_READ_GUIDANCE` (Verity, Lumen). Removed `phraseLedger` from `FILE_MANIFEST_KEYS`. Renamed `PHRASE_AUDIT_INSTRUCTIONS` → `MOTIF_AUDIT_INSTRUCTIONS` (now writes to motif-ledger.json). Renamed `PHRASE_AUDIT_CADENCE` → `MOTIF_AUDIT_CADENCE`. Updated `VERITY_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS` to use `flagged-phrase` violation type.
- `src/application/ChatService.ts` — Renamed `runPhraseAudit()` → `runMotifAudit()`. Audit chapter now loads `flaggedPhrases` from motif-ledger.json instead of reading phrase-ledger.md. Updated ad hoc revision pre-step.
- `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts` — Renamed IPC channel `verity:runPhraseAudit` → `verity:runMotifAudit`
- `src/preload/index.ts` — Renamed bridge method `runPhraseAudit` → `runMotifAudit`
- `src/renderer/stores/autoDraftStore.ts` — Renamed `PHRASE_AUDIT_CADENCE` → `MOTIF_AUDIT_CADENCE`, updated periodic audit labels and method calls
- `agents/LUMEN.md` — Lens 8 now writes flaggedPhrases to motif-ledger.json instead of phrase-ledger.md. Updated file ownership table.
- `agents/VERITY-AUDIT.md` — Renamed violation type, updated input description and flagging rules
- `agents/VERITY-DRAFT.md` — Removed phrase-ledger.md fallback, references motif ledger only
- `agents/VERITY-REVISION.md` — Removed phrase-ledger.md fallback, references motif ledger categories
- `agents/VERITY-LEDGER.md` — Removed migration instruction from phrase-ledger.md, updated flaggedPhrases description
- `agents/VERITY-LEGACY.md` — Replaced entire Phrase Ledger Format section with Motif Ledger integration. Updated pre-write, post-write, cross-check, and enforcement rules.
- `agents/VERITY-SCAFFOLD.md` — Updated "do not load" instruction

### Removed
- `source/phrase-ledger.md` concept — no longer produced or consumed by any agent or service
- `phraseLedger` key from `FILE_MANIFEST_KEYS`

### Architecture Impact
- Renamed IPC channel: `verity:runPhraseAudit` → `verity:runMotifAudit`
- Renamed bridge method: `verity.runPhraseAudit` → `verity.runMotifAudit`
- Renamed service method: `ChatService.runPhraseAudit()` → `ChatService.runMotifAudit()`
- `FILE_MANIFEST_KEYS` reduced from 14 to 13 entries

### Migration Notes
- Existing books with a `source/phrase-ledger.md` file: the file will be ignored. Its data should be manually migrated to the motif ledger's `flaggedPhrases` section if desired, but the system no longer reads or writes it.
- The IPC channel rename (`verity:runPhraseAudit` → `verity:runMotifAudit`) is a breaking change for any code calling the old channel name.

## [2026-03-27] — Create full architecture documentation from scratch

### Summary

Created all six architecture documentation files by reading every source file in the codebase and documenting the actual state. Covers all 5 layers: domain types/interfaces/constants, infrastructure modules and database schema, application services and orchestration logic, IPC channels and preload bridge shape, and renderer stores/components/views. Every file path, method signature, and IPC channel documented matches the actual code.

### Added
- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Master overview: layer diagram, source tree, service dependency graph, conventions, tech stack
- `docs/architecture/DOMAIN.md` — All types (60+ types cataloged), all interfaces (11 interfaces with full method tables), all constants
- `docs/architecture/INFRASTRUCTURE.md` — 6 infrastructure modules, 5 database tables with column details, CLI integration protocol, file watcher docs
- `docs/architecture/APPLICATION.md` — 8 application services with method tables, context assembly strategy, conversation compaction rules
- `docs/architecture/IPC.md` — 80+ IPC channels across 17 namespaces, 7 push events, full `window.novelEngine` preload bridge type shape
- `docs/architecture/RENDERER.md` — 13 Zustand stores, 8 views, 12 component groups (50+ components), 5 hooks

### Architecture Impact
- None — no wiring changes. Documentation only.

### Migration Notes
- None

## [2026-03-27] — Move architecture docs to docs/architecture/ subfolder

### Summary

Relocated all architecture documentation references from `docs/` to `docs/architecture/`. The `docs/` root already contained a landing page (`index.html`, `og-image.png`), so architecture docs now live in their own subfolder to avoid mixing concerns. Created the `docs/architecture/` directory and updated every reference in `AGENTS.md`.

### Added
- `docs/architecture/` — New directory for all architecture documentation files

### Changed
- `AGENTS.md` — Updated all 20+ references from `docs/*.md` to `docs/architecture/*.md` (Rule section, section headers, Workflow mappings, Edge Cases)

### Architecture Impact
- Documentation path convention changed: `docs/architecture/` is now the canonical location for ARCHITECTURE.md, DOMAIN.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md, APPLICATION.md, IPC.md, RENDERER.md

### Migration Notes
- Any existing `docs/*.md` architecture files (if created manually) should be moved to `docs/architecture/`
